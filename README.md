# MK - Phototagging

Wheres waldo based phototagging application, with a Mortal Kombat theme.

## Description

The motivation behind creating the application was to continue to test my skills and work on something that would challenge me to grow as a developer. The theme is based on Mortal Kombat because I knew it would be something that would keep the project fun. Especially since growing up my brother, cousin and I loved to play the video game.

### What I learned

- Creating and using custom hooks in React.
- Leverage and integrate Google Firestore DB with the application.
- More ways to leverage CSS Grid for more responsive layouts.
- How important data structure is for larger applications and how properly planning data structure can help avoid problems.

## Usage

1. You can click outside the modal to close the guide or hit the close button.
2. Then click on the background image in the body of the webpage to begin the timer.
3. Once you click on the background image you will have three options to select from.
4. Now you can search in the image for the three characters.
5. Once you have found all three, you can enter your initials to store your score. If done fast enough you may show in the top 5.
